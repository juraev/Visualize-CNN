## Introduction
In this project, we aim to replicate the experiments and techniques described in the paper ["Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks" by Zeiler and Fergus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901.pdf). The paper provides insights into the inner workings of CNNs and proposes visualization techniques to understand the learned features and activations.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pytorch
- torchvision

## To Do
- [ ] Visualizing the activations of the convolutional layery
- [x] Visualizing filters of the convolutional layers
